# MAGE :: PHP MySQL Admin Panel Generator
Available for Python also: [Python Mage](https://github.com/housamz/python-mysql-admin-panel-generator)

PHP MySQL Admin Panel Generator (MAGE), a PHP tool that helps you create a PHP Admin Panel for any MySQL database in seconds.

Mage is not PHPMyAdmin; it doesn't contain all your databases. It physically creates an admin panel for a database.

A suggested use-case for the tool would be creating an admin panel for a PHP / MySQL project in seconds, and then you can tweak it before delivery.

You may use this tool for charity or school projects, for commercial use, please contact me.

### Name

Mage (meɪdʒ): a magician or learned person.

### Disclaimer: Always backup your database.
